<h2>Memory controller using the FPGA and VHDL code.</h2>

As is stated in the Digilent Nexys Video reference guide, the Nexys Video Board has a 512MB external DDR3 SDRAM module, which is physically located just above the Artix-7 
FPGA on the Nexys Video board. In this lab, we will go through how to interface with this SDRAM to read and write data to different addresses in RAM, essentially
creating a memory controller. In this lab, the Microblaze CPU will not be used. However, the Microblaze can be added in future labs.

<h3>The SDRAM on the on the Nexys Video</h3>
Much of this information is derived from the Nexys Video reference manual.

The Nexys Video contains a single Micron MT41K256M16HA-187E DDR3 memory chip. The datasheet for the chip can be found
<a href="https://www.micron.com/~/media/documents/products/data-sheet/dram/ddr3/4gb_1_35v_ddr3l.pdf">here</a>. Let's break down what this part number means. The MT stands for
Micron Technology, and MT41K is the part number. Next, the 256M16 means the configuration of the chip. In this case, the configuration is 256 Meg x 16. Other possibilities
are 1G4 or 512M8. After the configuration of the chip is the package - HA in this case. HA means a 96-ball 9mm x 14mm FBGA package. The FBGA package is also what is printed 
on the second line of the physical SDRAM chip - D9PXV on the Nexys Video. The speed of the SDRAM is next, which is 187E in this case, 
which corresponds to a t<sub>ck</sub> of 1.875ns and CL = 7.

The schematics for the MT41K SDRAM included in the Nexys Video schematic pdf on page 13 is shown below.
