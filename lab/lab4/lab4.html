<h1>Lab 4 - Function generation</h1>
The goal of this lab is to generate an audio waveform with a high degree
of accuracy in both its period and frequency.  

<h2>First Step of Lab</h2>
The first thing to do is create a Bitbucket repo for this lab with a README file (can be in markdown, word, pdf, etc) which includes the Milestone Table shown in the README section below. You should update this as you achieve each milestone. Your instructor will go to this table first when grading each of your milestones, looking for evidence that the milestone was achieved.

<h2>Lab Overview</h2>
You are to use Direct Digital Synthesis to reproduce your audio waveform. For required functionality your system should create a sinusoid.
<del> For B-Level functionality, you must create a different waveform on the other channel.
You may choose any waveform so long as its not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">Piecewise Linear</a>.
A few interesting examples would be the sinc function, exponentially damped
sinusoids, or a waveform from a musical instrument (guitar, piano, or clarinet). </del>  It is  
your responsibility to get the samples for this waveform.  I would suggest
either deriving the waveform using a program like Python, Java, Matlab, or using a spreadsheet. 
Here is an example spreadsheet to create the BRAM initialization text for a 1024 entry LUT  
<a href="SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx">SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx</a> which you would need to modify for your size LUT.  
Consult the handout associated with 
<a href="../../lecture/lecture24.html">lesson 27</a> for more details 
on how to accomplish this.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
While you have the flexibility to design the waveform generator as you see 
fit, your system must meet the following requirements:
<ol>	<li>Use an update rate of 48kHz
	<li>Your function generator should be able to create a maximum frequency of 12000 Hz.
	<li>Your function generator should be able to create a minimum frequency between a 0.5 Hz and 1.0 Hz (this is also the minimum change in frequency).  
	<li>When your phase increment X = 1.0, the output frequency should be 200 Hz +/- 20 Hz.
	<li>Be able to generate a full amplitude waveform on your lab2 o'scope display.
	<li>Only one BRAM may be used for each channel.
	<li>A FSM must be used to control the datapath. 
	<li>Microblaze is not required, but may be used if desired.
</ol>


<h2>Hardware</h2>
You will have to generate the block diagram for your lab4 function generator and 
upload it to bitbucket for milestone 1.  Your design must be segregated into a lab4 datapath and a lab4
control unit. Your design must show the all the needed BBB design blocks in the lab4 datapath,
the states in the FSM, the control word, and the status word joining 
the datapath and control unit. All bus widths and Q formats for registers must be shown. This diagram must be neat and readable.

<br><br>
The final value for your left and right
signal you generate will be connected to the Codec's L_Bus_in and R_Bus_in so you can listen to the output tones using ear-buds or a speaker, 
and will also be sent to your Lab2 O'Scope.
Since you created an O'Scope in Lab2, you will use this to see your output signal on your monitor. 
Since your lab4 FSM and lab4 datapath will need the Audio_Codec_Wrapper (with Clock_Wiz_1) and "Ready" signal from Lab2,
the simpliest design is to put your Lab4 FSM and Lab4 datapath inside your lab2 block diagram.  
Therefore, you will also turn in a modified Lab2 block diagram with the Lab4 FSM and Lab4 datapath inside for milestone 1.  
You will not send the audio codec L_bus_out and R_bus_out as inputs to your Lab2 video,  but instead your lab4 datapath interpolator will create
the L_bus_out and R_bus_out and send this to the Lab2 video.
Since the lab4 hardware will be using all the buttons and switches, you need to delete the buttons in the Lab2 block diagram for tr_volt and tr_time.
For these two values, just hard-code them as a constant.

<br><br>
Signed Multiplication with Unsigned Data: Our VHDL multiplier does signed multiplication, not unsigned multiplication. While the input/output signals from the Audio Codec are signed, in lab2 we 
converted them to unsigned (18-bits) by:
<ul> 
<li> data_out_unsigned <= data_out_signed - x20000;
</ul>
Your lab2 BRAM and Scopeface are designed based on unsigned values (And the sine wave you initialize in your BRAM for lab4 is most likely unsigned),
so you will most likely want to do your interpolator math in unsigned values.  This raises 3 issues:
<ol> 
<li> We need to fool the signed multiplier to do unsigned multiplies. Signed numbers are only negative when the MSb is a "1". 
If the MSb is a '0', it is positive, it is unsigned.  If both operands have a MSb that is '0', 
then it is basically doing unsigned multiplication with a signed multiplier. For example:
<ul> 
<li> signal A,  B : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
<li> signal As, Bs     : signed(8 downto 0);
<li> signal Cs         : signed(17 downto 0);
<li> As <= signed('0' & A); -- add zero to ensure it is positive
<li> Bs <= signed('0' & B);
<li> Cs <= As * Bs;  -- fool signed multiply to do unsigned multiply
</ul>
<li> Our simple equation for interpolation:
<ul> 
<li> Interpolated = Base + (Next - Base )* Offset
</ul>
works great for signed numbers,  but has an issue for unsigned numbers. If Next is greater than Base, the math works.  What happens when Base is greater than Next? 
In this case, (Next - Base) would be negative, but unsigned signals cannot represent negative values. So here is pseudo-code for fixing this issue with unsigned numbers:
<ul> 
<li> If Next > Base then   
<li>    Interpolated = Base + (Next - Base ) * Offset;
<li> else
<li>    Interpolated = Base - (Base - Next ) * Offset;
<li> end if;
<li> 
</ul>
<li> The last issue is ensuring you align the binary points correctly for the math and grab the appropriate bits for the final answer, especially
since we appended a '0' to our input values.  [notation below: o is a ‘0’ and X is a hex digit]
<ul> 
<li> I append a ‘0’ to the MSb of Base (oXXXX.), Next (oXXXX.), offset (o.XX) and amp (oX.X), then kept track of the ‘o’ in later operations to make sure I aligned the binary points correctly.   
<li>     Delta = Next - Base;           — oXXXX. - oXXXX. = oXXXX.
<li>     Delta_Offset = Delta * Offset; — oXXXX. * o.XX = ooXXXX.XX
<li> For the next instruction, I need to add Base (oXXXX.) to Delta_Offset (ooXXXX.XX), To do this I need to align their binary point 
and make them have the same number of bits, so for Delta_Offset, I will remove its first ‘0’, and its last two hex digits XX, leaving it in the form oXXXX.
<li>     Interp = Base + Delta_Offset; — oXXXX. + oXXXX. = oXXXX.
<li>     Amp_Interp = Amp * Interp =  oX.X * oXXXX = ooXXXXX.X
<li> Then to send the final output signal, depends on how many bits your want, like 18 for the codec.  
In this case, I delete the two MSb “00” on the left, and then send the next 18 MSbs to the Codec 
(since this value is unsigned, and the codec needs a signed value, I subtract x”20000” from these 18 bits first)
</ul>
</ol>


<h2>Required Functionality</h2>
Use the slide switches and push buttons to manipulate the phase increment and the 
amplitude of the waveform as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pressing the left button should decrease the frequency of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Pressing the right button should increase the frequency of the waveform 
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
</ul>
For required functionality, Interpolation between the output samples is not required.

The waveform should be played back through the Audio Codec interface on the left channel. Remember to
wait for the ready signal.

<h2>B-level Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the up button should increase the amplitude of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Pressing the down button should decrease the amplitude of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li><del>Duplicate your hardware to produce a different waveform on the right channel. The left and right channels will share the same frequency and amplitude settings.</del>
</ul>
For B-level Interpolation between the output samples is not required.
<br><br>


<h2>A-level Functionality</h2>
<del>Use the microBlaze to capture a keyboard input to manipulate the amplitude and frequency.  The user
will enter in an integer frequency and you are to produce a waveform 
with that frequency. </del>
Modify the hardware for the right channel to interpolate between samples using (base + (next-base)*offset) method. You may swap A and B functionality if desired.
While I deleted the B-Level requirement this year to create a 2nd signal for channel 2 (requiring a different signal than a sine created in a 2nd BRAM and duplicate hardware), 
if you are going to try for A functionality and create the Interpolated signal (for channel 1), you also must create the un-interpolated signal (for channel 2), 
so you can compare ch1 and ch2 to see the difference. This does NOT require duplicate hardware, since in calculating the interpolated signal, 
you also already create the un-interpolated signal (known as BASE).  However, you will need the amplify BASE the same way you amplify the interpolated signal before if goes to channel 2. 

 

<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
At the COB of the day of the first lab session, you should have completed your design and uploaded it to bitbucket.
This should include the mathematical analysis you did to meet the requirements in the "Requirements" section above, concluding with the Q format required for your phase increment (like Qxx.xx).
Given your Q format, show calculations for 
<br>(1) phase increment needed for the maximum frequency of 12,000 Hz 
<br>(2) the size of the BRAM buffer needed, assuming it contains one cycle of a sinusoid 
<br>(3) the minimum frequency produced 
<br>(4) the frequency produced when your phase increment is 1.0
<br>(5) the phase increment value that gets you closest to 440Hz, and 
<br>(6) what that closest frequency to
440 Hz is that you can create.  
<br>[Hint: we did these calculations in the last slides for Lesson 26]
<br>You should also include the hardware block diagram design and the State Machine design for the items listed in the "Hardware" section above [the lab4 and modified lab3 block diagrams]. The block diagrams must look professional and not sloppy.
 These diagrams must contain the following:
<ul>
<li>A border defining the top-level entity.  Borders for each of the 
	components instantiated within the top-level entity.
<li>All components must be named in the upper left corner.
<li>All signals entering and exiting components must have their 
	port name defined just inside the border.
<li>All signals outside the components must have their width defined (if more than one bit)
	as well as be labeled with their names. The Q format should be specified on the BBBs where appropriate. 
<li>Here is a draft of a portion of the example Lab4 block diagram, <a href="Interpolation_block_diagram.pptx">Interpolation Block Diagram</a>
	
</ul>
To determine the frequency of your signals, we need to know what the time axis is for the lab2 O'scope you created. [Remember: frequency = 1/(period of one cycle)]
You are filling your lab2 BRAM at a rate of 48KHz, so each scopeface pixel (or column count) corresponds in time to 1/(48 kHz) = 20.8333333 micro-seconds.
You are drawing the wave from column 20 to 620, or 600 pixels. 
<br>(7) how long in time do these 600 pixels represent?
<br>Your scopeface grid should have 10 major grid blocks, each with a width of 60 pixels. 
<br>(8) how long in time do these grid blocks represent?
<br>(9) If your function generate creates a sine wave such that exactly two cycles of the sinewave fit on your scopeface (ie., across 600 pixels), what is the frequency of this sine wave?
<br>(10) What must your phase increment be to generate this sine wave?

<h2>Milestone 2</h2>
At the COB of the day of the second lab period, you should have a working testbench testing your lab4 hardware block diagram.
When simulating your design, have the testbench supply a mock ready signal (clock at 48 kHz)
in place of the ready signal generated the Audio_Codec_Wrapper (when put in a testbench,
the Audio_Codec_Wrapper is not able to generate a ready signal without a lot of 
extra work).
<br><br>

When complete, I expect your timing diagram to look similar to the image below 
and contain at least:
<ul>	<li>clk
	<li>reset
	<li>ready (simulated using CSA statements in teshbench)
	<li>FSM state
	<li>Phase increment 
	<li>Index.Offset register
	<li>BRAM address
	<li>BRAM data out [Base]
	<li>BRAM data out [Next] (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Interpolated Value [Base + (Next - Base)*Offset] (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Amplitude coefficient (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Multiplied data out (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Slide switches
	<li>Button values
</ul>

Your simulation needs to simulate a button press (and release) to 
change the phase increment. After that is done, you need to show that the BRAM
address is being incremented by your new phase increment value. You need to describe in words and/or math 
what we are seeing in your simulation plot, to justify that your VHDL code is working (do not only include the plot with no description)

<br><img src="./lab4-1.gif"><br><br>

For Milestone 2, also describe your method for creating your BRAM look-up tables for your waveforms in your README, and upload any code (like spreadsheets or python code) used.
Here is an example spreadsheet to create the BRAM initialization text for a 1024 entry LUT  
<a href="SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx">SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx</a> which you would need to modify for your size LUT.

<h2>README</h2>
The README writeup should include:
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 products (Design and solutions to the 10 design questions)
<li>Milestone 2 simulation results and description of your method for creating your BRAM look-up tables for your waveforms (also upload any code like spreadsheets used.)
<li>Proof (such as a stream or youtube video) that you met Required, B, and A functionality (or statement you demonstrated to Dr York), with the date/time.
For Required functionality, did your audio out work? Include images of your scopeface plots showing
 (1) the output waveform when x is set to produce exactly 2 cycles of a sine wave across the 600 pixels on your scopeface display  [does this match your calculated frequency and phase increment?]
 (2) the output waveform when x = 1.0 [does this match your calculated frequency, based on your scopeface grid timing calculations?], and 
 (3) the output waveform with x set to create ~440Hz [does this match your calculated frequency, based on your scopeface grid timing calculations?]
For B-level functionality, include images of scopeface plots showing
 (1) the output waveform with your default amplitude, and
 (2) the output waveform after you increase (or decrease) the amplitude of your signal [does this match your calculations based on the switch settings?]
For A-level functionality, include an image of your o'scope plot showing channel-1 (not interpolated) and channel-2 (interpolated).  
Try to pick a frequency such that interpolated looks better than non-interpolated.
<li>Remember to upload your code with proper headers and comments

<li><strong>Results</strong> - Since we no longer use the printed lab cutsheets
signed by your instructor as you meet each milestone, this section should clearly
state for each milestone/functionality the date/time it was achieved, level of achievement 
(e.g, achieved, partially-achieved, not achieved), what was achieved, and how you proved it 
(via demo or evidence like images/videos).  
For example, you could have a table like this:
