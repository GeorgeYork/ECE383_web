<h1>Lab 4 - Function generation</h1>
The goal of this lab is to generate an audio waveform with a high degree
of accuracy in both its period and frequency.  

<h2>Lab Overview</h2>
You are to use Direct Digital Synthesis to reproduce your audio waveform.
You may choose any waveform so long as its not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">Piecewise Linear</a>.
A few interesting examples would be sinusoids, the sinc function, exponentially damped
sinusoids, or a waveform from a musical instrument (guitar, piano, or clarinet).  It is  
your responsibility to get the samples for this waveform.  I would suggest
either deriving the waveform using a program like Python, using a spreadsheet, or
digitizing the samples using Lab 3.  Once you have your data, hardwired it 
into BRAM using "init" statements.  Consult the handout associated with 
<a href="../../lecture/lecture24.html">lesson 24</a> for more details 
on how to accomplish this.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
While you have the flexibility to design the waveform generator as you see 
fit, your system must meet the following requirements:
<ol>	<li>Use an update rate of 48kHz
	<li>At 440Hz, the LUT should be incremented by about 1 index.
	<li>Be able to make between a 1Hz and 0.25Hz change in frequency.  
	<li>Be able to generate a full amplitude waveform.
</ol>


<h2>Hardware</h2>
You will have to generate the block diagram for this assignment and 
present it at the beginning of the second lab session for review by 
your professor.  Your design must be segregated into a datapath and 
control unit. Your design must show the blocks in the datapath,
the states in the FSM, the control word, and the status word joining 
the datapath and control unit.

<h2>Required Functionality</h2>
Use the slide switches and push buttons to manipulate the phase angle and the 
amplitude of the waveform as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pressing the left button should decrease the frequency of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Pressing the right button should increase the frequency of the waveform 
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
</ul>
Interpolation between the output samples is not required.

The waveform should be played back through the Audio Codec interface on the left channel. Remember to
wait for the ready signal.

<h2>B-level Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the up button should increase the amplitude of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Pressing the down button should decrease the amplitude of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Duplicate your hardware to produce a different waveform on the right channel. The left and right channels will share the same frequency and amplitude settings.
</ul>
Interpolation between the output samples is not required.


<h2>A-level Functionality</h2>
<del>Use the microBlaze to capture a keyboard input to manipulate the amplitude and frequency.  The user
will enter in an integer frequency and you are to produce a waveform 
with that frequency. </del>
Modify the hardware for the right channel to interpolate between samples using (base + next-base)*offset) method

<h2>Bonus Functionality</h2>
Connect your A-level Function Generator hardware to either your Lab2 or Lab 3 functionality 
to enable the display of your generated signals on your O'scope display. 

<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
At the end of the first lab session, you should have completed your design and uploaded it to bitbucket.
This should include the mathematical analysis you did to meet the requirements in the "Requirements" section above, concluding with the Q format required for your phase increment (like Q10.6).
Given your Q format, show calculations for (1) the minimum frequency produced (2) the frequency produced when your phase increment is 1.0, and (3) your maximum frequency before aliasing occurs.
It should also include the design for the items listed in the "Hardware" section above.
The hardware diagram using BBB (Basic Building Blocks) should be drawn in paint or another image editing software 
that is readable and can be printed onto an 8.5x11 sheet of
paper.  Provide me with a hardcopy of your schematic at the end of
class and upload to bitbucket.  This diagram must contain the following:
<ul>
<li>A border defining the top-level entity.  Borders for each of the 
	components instantiated within the top-level entity.
<li>All components must be named in the upper left corner.
<li>All signals entering and exiting components must have their 
	port name defined just inside the border.
<li>All signals outside the components must have their width defined (if more than one bit)
	as well as be labeled with their names. The Q format should be specified on the BBBs where appropriate. 
</ul>

<h2>Milestone 2</h2>
At the end of the second lab period, you should have a working testbench.
When simulating your design, have the testbench supply a mock ready signal
in place of the ready signal generated the Audio_Codec_Wrapper (when put in a testbench,
the Audio_Codec_Wrapper is not able to generate a ready signal without a lot of 
extra work).
<br><br>

When complete, I expect your timing diagram to look like the image below 
and contain at least:
<ul>	<li>clk
	<li>reset
	<li>ready (simulated using CSA statements in teshbench)
	<li>FSM state
	<li>BRAM address
	<li>Phase increment
	<li>BRAM data out
	<li>Amplitude cofficient (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Multiplied data out (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Slide switches
	<li>Button values
</ul>

Your simulation needs to simulate a button press (and release) to 
change the phase increment. After that is done, you need to show that the BRAM
address is being incremented by your new phase increment value.

<h2>README</h2>
The README writeup should include:
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 products (Design)
<li>Milestone 2 simulation results
<li>Proof (such as a youtube video) that you met Required, B, and A functionality (or statement you demonstrated to Dr York), with the date/time.
</ul>
