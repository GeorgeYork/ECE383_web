<h1>Lab 4 - Function generation</h1>
The goal of this lab is to generate an audio waveform with a high degree
of accuracy in both its period and frequency.  

<h2>First Step of Lab</h2>
The first thing to do is create a Bitbucket repo for this lab with a README file (can be in markdown, word, pdf, etc) which includes the Milestone Table shown in the README section below. You should update this as you achieve each milestone. Your instructor will go to this table first when grading each of your milestones, looking for evidence that the milestone was achieved.

<h2>Lab Overview</h2>
You are to use Direct Digital Synthesis to reproduce your audio waveform. For required functionality your system should create a sinusoid.
<del> For B-Level functionality, you must create a different waveform on the other channel.
You may choose any waveform so long as its not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function">Piecewise Linear</a>.
A few interesting examples would be the sinc function, exponentially damped
sinusoids, or a waveform from a musical instrument (guitar, piano, or clarinet). </del>  It is  
your responsibility to get the samples for this waveform.  I would suggest
either deriving the waveform using a program like Python, Java, Matlab, or using a spreadsheet. 
Here is an example spreadsheet to create the BRAM initialization text for a 1024 entry LUT  
<a href="SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx">SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx</a> which you would need to modify for your size LUT.  
Consult the handout associated with 
<a href="../../lecture/lecture24.html">lesson 27</a> for more details 
on how to accomplish this.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
While you have the flexibility to design the waveform generator as you see 
fit, your system must meet the following requirements:
<ol>	<li>Use an update rate of 48kHz
	<li>Your function generator should be able to create a maximum frequency of 12000 Hz without aliasing.
	<li>Your function generator should be able to create a minimum frequency between a 0.5 Hz and 1.0 Hz (this is also the minimum change in frequency).  
	<li>When your phase increment X = 1.0, the output frequency should be 200 Hz +/- 20 Hz.
	<li>Be able to generate a full amplitude waveform.
	<li>Only one BRAM may be used for each channel.
	<li>A FSM must be used to control the datapath. 
	<li>Microblaze is not required, but may be used if desired.
</ol>


<h2>Hardware</h2>
You will have to generate the block diagram for your lab4 function generator and 
upload it to bitbucket for milestone 1.  Your design must be segregated into a datapath and 
control unit. Your design must show the blocks in the datapath,
the states in the FSM, the control word, and the status word joining 
the datapath and control unit. All bus widths and Q formats for registers must be shown. This diagram must be neat and readable.
Your lab4 block diagram will need to borrow the Audio_Codec_Wrapper (with Clock_Wiz_1) from the Lab#2 block diagram.  
The Codec will produce the "Ready" signal you will feed as a input signal into your FSM. The final value for your left and right
signal you generate will be connected to the Codec's L_Bus_in and R_Bus_in so you can listen to the output tones using ear-buds or a speaker.
<br><br>
Since you most likely do not have an oscilloscope at home to see your output signal, you will use your Lab#2 o'scope, which will need to be modified. 
You will also turn in a modified Lab2 block diagram for milestone 1.  The modified Lab2 block diagram no longer needs the Audio_Codec_Wrapper 
(which is now inside the block diagram for Lab4).  Instead Lab2 will receive L_bus_out, R_bus_out, and Ready from Lab4 block diagram. 
Since the lab4 hardware will be using all the buttons and switches, you need to delete the buttons in the Lab2 block diagram for tr_volt and tr_time.
For these two values, just hard-code them as a constant.

<h2>Required Functionality</h2>
Use the slide switches and push buttons to manipulate the phase increment and the 
amplitude of the waveform as follows:
<ul>
<li>Pressing the left button should decrease the frequency of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Pressing the right button should increase the frequency of the waveform 
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
</ul>
For required functionality, Interpolation between the output samples is not required.

The waveform should be played back through the Audio Codec interface on the left channel. Remember to
wait for the ready signal.

<h2>B-level Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the up button should increase the amplitude of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li>Pressing the down button should decrease the amplitude of the waveform
	by the amount set on the slide switches.
<li><del>Duplicate your hardware to produce a different waveform on the right channel. The left and right channels will share the same frequency and amplitude settings.</del>
</ul>
For B-level Interpolation between the output samples is not required.
<br><br>
Hints for the amplification: Amplitude multiplication must be done on signed values, so either
<ul> 
<li> Make your sine wave BRAM LUT values signed, or
<li> As you read these BRAM LUT values out, convert them from unsigned to signed (i.e., subtract 0x8000), or
<li> Before multiplication, convert from unsigned to signed (i.e., subtract 0x8000)
<li> [Another Note: it appears the multiplication of two signed numbers (where one is really unsigned) still works (i.e., it doesn't sign extend...)]
</ul>

<h2>A-level Functionality</h2>
<del>Use the microBlaze to capture a keyboard input to manipulate the amplitude and frequency.  The user
will enter in an integer frequency and you are to produce a waveform 
with that frequency. </del>
Modify the hardware for the right channel to interpolate between samples using (base + next-base)*offset) method. You may swap A and B functionality if desired.
 

<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
At the COB of the day of the first lab session, you should have completed your design and uploaded it to bitbucket.
This should include the mathematical analysis you did to meet the requirements in the "Requirements" section above, concluding with the Q format required for your phase increment (like Qxx.xx).
Given your Q format, show calculations for 
<br>(1) phase increment needed for the maximum frequency without aliasing 
<br>(2) the size of the BRAM buffer needed, assuming it contains one cycle of a sinusoid 
<br>(3) the minimum frequency produced 
<br>(4) the frequency produced when your phase increment is 1.0
<br>(5) the phase increment value that gets you closest to 440Hz, and 
<br>(6) what that closest frequency to
440 Hz is that you can create.  
<br>[Hint: we did these calculations in the last slides for Lesson 26]
<br>You should also include the hardware block diagram design and the State Machine design for the items listed in the "Hardware" section above [the lab4 and modified lab3 block diagrams]. The block diagrams must look professional and not sloppy.
 These diagrams must contain the following:
<ul>
<li>A border defining the top-level entity.  Borders for each of the 
	components instantiated within the top-level entity.
<li>All components must be named in the upper left corner.
<li>All signals entering and exiting components must have their 
	port name defined just inside the border.
<li>All signals outside the components must have their width defined (if more than one bit)
	as well as be labeled with their names. The Q format should be specified on the BBBs where appropriate. 
<li>Here is a draft of a portion of the example Lab4 block diagram, <a href="Interpolation_block_diagram.pptx">Interpolation Block Diagram</a>
	
</ul>
To determine the frequency of your signals, we need to know what the time axis is for the lab2 O'scope you created. [Remember: frequency = 1/(period of one cycle)]
You are filling your lab2 BRAM at a rate of 48KHz, so each scopeface pixel (or column count) corresponds in time to 1/(48 kHz) = 20.8333333 micro-seconds.
You are drawing the wave from column 20 to 620, or 600 pixels. 
<br>(7) how long in time do these 600 pixels represent?
<br>Your scopeface grid should have 10 major grid blocks, each with a width of 60 pixels. 
<br>(8) how long in time do these grid blocks represent?
<br>(9) If your function generate creates a sine wave such that exactly two cycles of the sinewave fit on your scopeface (ie., across 600 pixels), what is the frequency of this sine wave?
<br>(10) What must your phase increment be to generate this sine wave?

<h2>Milestone 2</h2>
At the COB of the day of the second lab period, you should have a working testbench testing your lab4 hardware block diagram.
When simulating your design, have the testbench supply a mock ready signal (clock at 48 kHz)
in place of the ready signal generated the Audio_Codec_Wrapper (when put in a testbench,
the Audio_Codec_Wrapper is not able to generate a ready signal without a lot of 
extra work).
<br><br>

When complete, I expect your timing diagram to look similar to the image below 
and contain at least:
<ul>	<li>clk
	<li>reset
	<li>ready (simulated using CSA statements in teshbench)
	<li>FSM state
	<li>BRAM address
	<li>Phase increment
	<li>BRAM data out
	<li>Amplitude coefficient (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Multiplied data out (if aiming for B or A functionality)
	<li>Slide switches
	<li>Button values
</ul>

Your simulation needs to simulate a button press (and release) to 
change the phase increment. After that is done, you need to show that the BRAM
address is being incremented by your new phase increment value. You need to describe in words and/or math 
what we are seeing in your simulation plot, to justify that your VHDL code is working (do not only include the plot with no description)

<br><img src="./lab4-1.gif"><br><br>

For Milestone 2, also describe your method for creating your BRAM look-up tables for your waveforms in your README, and upload any code (like spreadsheets or python code) used.
Here is an example spreadsheet to create the BRAM initialization text for a 1024 entry LUT  
<a href="SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx">SineWaveLUT_1024.xlsx</a> which you would need to modify for your size LUT.

<h2>README</h2>
The README writeup should include:
<ul>
<li>Milestone 1 products (Design and solutions to the 10 design questions)
<li>Milestone 2 simulation results and description of your method for creating your BRAM look-up tables for your waveforms (also upload any code like spreadsheets used.)
<li>Proof (such as a stream or youtube video) that you met Required, B, and A functionality (or statement you demonstrated to Dr York), with the date/time.
For Required functionality, include images of your scopeface plots showing (1) the output waveform when x is set to produce exactly 2 cycles of a sine wave across the 600 pixels on your scopeface display  
 (2) the output waveform when x = 1.0 [does this match your calculated frequency, based on your scopeface grid timing calculations?], and 
 (3) the output waveform with x set to create ~440Hz [does this match your calculated frequency, based on your scopeface grid timing calculations?]
For B-level functionality, include images of scopeface plots showing (1) the output waveform with your default amplitude, and (2) the output waveform after you increase (or decrease) the amplitude of your signal [does this match your calculations based on the switch settings?]
For A-level functionality, include an image of the logic analyzer plot showing channel-1 (not interpolated) and channel-2 (interpolated).  Try to pick a frequency such that interpolated looks better than non-interpolated.
<li>Remember to upload your code with proper headers and comments

<li><strong>Results</strong> - Since we no longer use the printed lab cutsheets
signed by your instructor as you meet each milestone, this section should clearly
state for each milestone/functionality the date/time it was achieved, level of achievement 
(e.g, achieved, partially-achieved, not achieved), what was achieved, and how you proved it 
(via demo or evidence like images/videos).  
For example, you could have a table like this:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
