<H1>Xilinx Artix-7 architecture</H1>
The Artix-7 consists of Logic Blocks, Block RAM, DSP blocks,
and a global routing network.  We will spend most of our time
discussing the Logic Blocks.  But before we do, a note about
the Xilinx design paradigm.  Modern reconfigurable logic exists
because logic designs can easily be expressed in terms of medium
scale logic building blocks, such as registers, shift registers,
multiplexers, counters, adders, subtractors, and comparators.  Consider
the following output from during the synthesis of Lab 4 
(via Xilinx ISE and Spartan-6 FPGA).

The Xilinx software decomposed my design into the basic building
blocks mentioned above.  This is one reason that I insisted on certain coding
practices - they increase the likelihood that your designs will
be efficiently mapped into these basic building blocks.  Now, consider
the question: "What should be included in the FPGA fabric to create these basic building
blocks?" Clearly, logic elements that can efficiently
realize these basic building blocks should be included.  And that is precisely what 
Xilinx has done with its software.  How they do it is explained below.

<h2>Logic Blocks</h2>
Note: Everything in this section and the following sections is derived from the
<a href=https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug474_7Series_CLB.pdf>Xilinx 7-Series FPGAs Configurable Logic Block (CLB) User Guide</a>.
<br>
A configurable logic block (CLB) is a basic block used to implement the logic behind the VHDL designs we have been working on all
semester. In FPGAs, hundreds or thousands of CLBs are laid out in an array (commonly a switch matrix) known as the
global routing network. All of the CLBs on the FPGA are connected to each other. On the Artix-7 (and other Xilinx 7-series boards), 
each CLB contains two Logic Slices (which are covered in the following section). The logical layout of a CLB can be seen in the Figure below.
<img src="./img/lecture30-1.gif"><br>

<h2>Logic Slices</h2>
The Artix-7 on our board (the Artix-7 7A200T) has a total of 33,650 logic slices (16,825 CLBs).
Each logic slice contains four 6-input LUTs and eight flip-flops. This corresponds to 
134,600 total 6-input LUTs.<br>
There are three possible types of logic slices: SLICEM, SLICEL, and SLICEX. However, in the Artix-7,
SLICEX slices are unused; of the 33,650 logic slices, 22,100 are SLICEL and 11,550 are SLICEM.
In the subsequent sections, we will examine the slice with the most features: SLICEM.
A diagram of a SLICEM block is shown below.

<img src="./img/lecture30-2.gif"><br><br>

In the diagram of the SLICEM block, three major subystems can be seen: 1. the four 6-input LUTs 2. the eight flip-flops and 3. the fast carry logic.
These subsystems will be discussed in the subsequent sections.
The inputs to and outputs from this slice are denoted with I/O flags (i.e. A6:A1, AQ).

<h3>1. Look-up tables</h3>
If you need a refresher on how a hardware LUT works, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table#Hardware_LUTs">this link</a>.
In a SLICEM, there are four 64x1 RAMs which are used to 
realize 5 or 6-variable functions; the truth table for the function is 
stored in the RAM and the inputs are used as the input addresses. As an example,
let's try to realize a full adder using a RAM.   In class, we
will derive the truth table for sum and carry and show how they
can be inserted into a LUT.  It is important for the further development
of the lecture to point out that sum = a xor b xor c and that you can
represent cout = ((a xor b) and cin) or (a and b)  This last form is
pretty nutty, but is also very useful, as we will see in a moment.


<h3>2. Flip Flops</h3>
There are 8 flip flops in each logic slice. Answer the following questions:
<ul>	<li>Where does the data input come from?
	<li>How are the slices clocked?
	<li>How are the slices initialized?
	<li>Where are the slices' outputs sent?
</ul>

<h3>3. Fast Carry Logic</h3>
The fast carry logic is designed explicitly to realize a variation
of a carry look-ahead adder.  Consider the construction of a 4-bit
adder with inputs A=a3,a2,a1,a0 , B=b3,b2,b1,b0 , and a carry in c0. 
Each slice of the adder can either generate a carry bit or 
propagate its carry in to the carry out.

<UL>
<LI>Propagate -- pi is equal to 1 when the inputs to a bit slice are such
	 that any carry in will be propagated. 
<LI>Generate  -- gi is equal to 1 when the inputs to a bit slice are
	 such that a cay will be generated. 
</UL>

We can represent the cout of a slice as cout = g + p*cin.  This arrangement
is effectively what is happening in the carry logic block in the middle of
each logic slice.

<h2>Interconnect</h2>
A logical figure of how the CLBs on the Artix-7 are interconnected to each other can be seen in the Figure below (taken from Spartan-6 documentation).

Taken from the <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug384.pdf">"Spartan-6 FPGA Configurable Logic Block User's Guide"</a>, 
page 37, Figure 29.<br><br>

<h2>DSP Slice</h2>
Apart from the slices which make up the CLBs discussed above, each FPGA also contains DSP slices. The Artix-7 we are using, for example, contains 700 DSP48E1 slices.
Each DSP slice contains a pre-adder, a 25 x 18 multiplier, an adder, and an accumulator. A picture of a DSP slice can be seen in the Figure below.
