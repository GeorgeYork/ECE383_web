<h1>Homework #3</h1>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Complete your work on green engineering paper
<li>Staple in upper left if more than one sheet.
<li>Format the top of the first sheet as follows.
<table border =1>
<tr><td>ECE 383	<td>[Your name]	<td>HW#1	<td>[Due Date]	<td>[Page ref]
</table>
The page reference for the first page of a four page document would be 1/4, the
second page of this document would be labeled 2/4 and so on.  
<li>Do not write on the back side of the green engineering paper
<li>Digital copies of all code, testbenches, and waveforms will also be submitted via BitBucket.
</ul>

<ol>
<li>[3.5] Assume that a is a 10-bit signal with the std_logic_vector(9 downto 0) data type.  
List the 10 bits assigned to the a signal. 
	<ol type = "a">
			<li>a <= (others => '1');
			<li>a <= (1|3|5|7|9 => '1', others => '0');
			<li>a <= (9|7|2 => '1', 6 => '0', 0 => '1', 1|5|8 => '0', 3|4 => '0'); 
	</ol>
<li>[3.6] Assume that a and y are 8-bit signals with the std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) data type.  
If the signals are interpreted as unsigned numbers, the following assignment statement performs a / 8.  
Explain.
	y <= "000" & a(7 downto 3); 
<li>[3.7] Assume the same a as in Problem 3.6.  We want to perform a mod 8 and assign the result to y.  
Rewrite the previous signal assignment statement using only the & operator.
<li> Draw a hardware schematic, similar to the one at the end of lecture 3,
for the following circuits.  You are given comparators, muxes and adders;
do NOT show the internal organization of these devices.  Whenever possible 
reduce the number of devices required to realize the design.  You should
assume that X, Y, and Z are unsigned(7 downto 0).

<ol type = "a">
        <li> if (X==0) then Z = X else Z = Y
        <li> if (X==Y) then Z = Y else Z = X+Y
        <li> if (X < Y) then Z = X+4 else Z = Y+6
        <li> if (X > Y) then Z = X+5 else Z = X+6
</ol>

<li>
Create a digital circuit that takes as input a 8-bit unsigned value 
(provided by the DIP switches) and illuminates an LED if the input
is a multiple of 17. Do NOT use the remainder or division operations,
this can easily be accomplished using a single conditional signal
assignment statement.

<ul>
<li>A hardcopy (plus digital copy via BitBucket) of your VHDL file (include a proper header).
<li>A hardcopy (plus digital copy via BitBucket) of a timing diagram from Isim showing several inputs and the output.
<li>A hardcopy (plus digital copy via BitBucket) of your UCF file.
<li>Digital copy of your BIT file via BitBucket.
<li>Demo your circuit in class on LSN 4.
</ul>
