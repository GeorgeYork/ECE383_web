<h1>Homework #10</h1>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Complete your work on green engineering paper
<li>Staple in upper left if more than one sheet.
<li>Format the top of the first sheet as follows.
<table border =1>
<tr><td>ECE 383	<td>[Your name]	<td>HW#10	<td>[Due Date]	<td>[Page ref]
</table>
The page reference for the first page of a four page document would be 1/4, the
second page of this document would be labeled 2/4 and so on.  
<li>Do not write on the back side of the green engineering paper
<li>Digital copies of all code, testbenches, and waveforms will also be submitted via BitBucket.
</ul>
<br><br>


<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ol>
<li>Complete the development of the example in Lecture 18.
<li>Modify the lec10 component to include a roll signal that
is asserted whenever the counter is at the maximum count value.
In order to accomplish this with the generic counter width
you may need to create a temporary signal that is equal to the
highest count value (see below). Add the roll signal as an output to be displayed just 
like the count value on the help menu (FYI, If you load a Capital E and then
count up you can get to max count).  Be prepared to demo your circuit at the beginning of Lesson 19. 

<pre>
    maxCount <= (others => '1');
</pre>

<h2>Note</h2>
You will most likely get an error that looks like the following:
<pre>
'Invoking: MicroBlaze Print Size'

<br><br>

Look at the MicroBlaze Print Size address editor and you will find that the value 
under dec (size of your program (instructions + data) in decimal bytes) 
is the 32k you allocated in Vivado for the microblaze memory.  You should be good but
potentially you may have to increase the size of the instruction and data memory in Vivado and 
recompile (see figure below). As you will see in the Print Size output
above, I ran into this problem when my program JUST exceeded the 16K 
I had allocated for it in Vivado.

After you make this change, you will need to increase the stack and heap
space inside SDK.  Since you already started with 32K you may only have to 
increase the stack and heap in SDK.  To do this, open the linker script (lscript.ld) and then
increase the size of your memory to reflect the size entered in Vivado.  Finally
you can increase the stack and heap sizes to cover that needed in the error
message.
