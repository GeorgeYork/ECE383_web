<h1>Homework #13</h1>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Complete your work on green engineering paper
<li>Staple in upper left if more than one sheet.
<li>Format the top of the first sheet as follows.
<table border =1>
<tr><td>ECE 383	<td>[Your name]	<td>HW#11	<td>[Due Date]	<td>[Page ref]
</table>
The page reference for the first page of a four page document would be 1/4, the
second page of this document would be labeled 2/4 and so on.  
<li>Do not write on the back side of the green engineering paper
<li>Digital copies of all code, testbenches, and waveforms will also be submitted via BitBucket.
</ul>
<br><br>


<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ol>
<li>Complete the development of the handout in Lecture 26.  Use the equations presented in class 
to generate the coefficients for a 2nd order low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 300Hz.
<li>Convert the coefficients to Q2.30 binary equivalent.
<li>Add the binary Q2.30 coefficients to the right channel of filter example given in Lecture 26 
and put it on the Atlys board to verify functionality and push completed files.
</ul></ol>

<!-------------------
No I didn't put the solutions here.  But hey, you get a pat 
on the back for trying!  Now solve the problems yourself.
