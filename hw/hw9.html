<h1>Homework #9</h1>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Complete your work on green engineering paper
<li>Staple in upper left if more than one sheet.
<li>Format the top of the first sheet as follows.
<table border =1>
<tr><td>ECE 383	<td>[Your name]	<td>HW#9	<td>[Due Date]	<td>[Page ref]
</table>
The page reference for the first page of a four page document would be 1/4, the
second page of this document would be labeled 2/4 and so on.  
<li>Do not write on the back side of the green engineering paper
<li>Digital copies of all code, testbenches, and waveforms will also be submitted via BitBucket.
</ul>
<br><br>


<ol>
<li>Complete the tutorial given in Lesson 17 to write to your UART and display the "Welcome to Lecture 17" on your terminal.  
<li><del>Upon completion of the MicroBlaze Tutorial you with then add in GPIO LEDs into your hardware design and build the software that reads in a value from UART, echoes that value to the UART and LEDs.</del>  
<li><del>Be prepared to demo your circuit at the beginning of Lesson 18.</del>
<li>Additionally, Start a new MicroBlaze Project for Lecture 18 all the way through exporting to the SDK for Hello World.  Don't implement the GPIO LEDs in that project.
