            <h1>Labs</h1>
<p>The labs in this course are very hardware intensive. A disciplined approach to design, implementation and testing are key to your success! The Big Bang method, or wiring and coding something up and debugging it until it works, usually does not work. We do allow you to turn in incomplete labs, but up to 25% can be deducted for not meeting requirements (See lab grading and late work policies below).</p>
<h2>Lab Notebooks</h2>
<p>Lab notebooks must follow the lab notebook standards specified in ECE382. The lab notebook is maintained as a journal of your lab experience and should allow you, or any knowledgeable engineer, to recreate your project. For each laboratory assignment, you will turn in a short formal report that summarizes the contents of your lab notebook.</p>
